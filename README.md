## PQweb
An online calculator for physical quantities. There are many unit conversion programs out there, but most of them only let you convert
similar types of quantities: you must pick "length" mode, select "from pounds", then "to kg", click again, type a number, and get the answer.

Instead, this program lets you simply type an expression like
``` (10 mi + 20 km) / 1 h ```
and it gives you a speed, which you can express in whatever units you like by adding `, unit1 unit2 unit3`... etc

Example:
``` (10 mi + 20 km) / 20 min, mph ```
... gives an answer of `67.2823 mph`.

Features include:
	- Preferred units setting
	- Define custom variables
	- Recall history
	- Quick copy-to-clipboard button
	- Examine similar units
	- Mobile-friendly key pad so you can stay in letter mode.
	- Import/export
	- Uses browser's local storage.
	- No installation necessary
	- No data sent back to server.
