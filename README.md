## PQweb
An online calculator for physical quantities.

It could be called a unit converter, but that's not the whole story. There are many unit conversion programs out there, but most of them only let you convert similar types of quantities: you must pick "length" mode, select "from pounds", then "to kg", click again, type a number, and get the answer.

Instead, this program lets you type an expression like
``` (10 mi + 20 km) / 1 h ```
and it gives you a speed, which you can express in whatever units you like by adding a comma, e.g. `, mph` in which case the answer of `67.2823 mph`.

So, any mathematical expression involving basic arithmetic operations can be evaluated with physical units included.


Features include:
	- Preferred units setting
	- Define custom variables
	- Recall history
	- Quick copy-to-clipboard button
	- Examine similar units
	- Mobile-friendly key pad so you can stay in letter mode.
